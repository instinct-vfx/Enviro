        <h3>Welcome to Enviro!</h3>

<p>After many fails, times i thought I succeeded and fails again when it comes to properly implementing channel handling in some of my custom ops I thought I’d start a public exercise to get a re-usable template for this specific case.
I will make all my findings public as well as share the final result and I am eager to get any input anyone might have. Be it functional, correcting bugs or tuning performance/efficiency.</p>

<p>So as a starting point I will describe what the node is supposed to do and what kind of cases it should correctly handle. Of course I might be missing obvious cases, so please do add whatever you find useful.</p>

<p>In order to make this not only an academic exercise I thought of the following use-case (yet to be determined if implementing the actual calculations is part of the exercise):</p>

<p>An Environment Reflection node similar to Ivan’s EnvReflection on Nukepedia (<a href="http://www.nukepedia.com/plugins/other/envreflection/">http://www.nukepedia.com/plugins/other/envreflection/</a>)
The node uses P and N passes as well as a camera and an environment map to generate an environment reflection pass.</p>

<p>While the node works fine as is, I want our implementation to pull N and P from layers in input0 rather than being separate inputs.
In addition I want to make it the user’s choice if he wants to overwrite RGB, any other channel or send the result to a totally new channel.</p>

<p>So here is a quick run-down:</p>

<ul>
<li>From input0 copy all unused channels to output, also copy all un-changed inputs to output (we’re going to read from N and P, but not change it usually)</li>
<li>From input0 grab 2 layers (N and P respectively)</li>
<li>Make sure the 2 layers have 3 channels and grab them (also copy them to output unless the user selected one of the two as output layer</li>
<li>From input1 pull the environment map (obviously this SHOULD be a different input)</li>
<li>From input2 pull the camera data (optional: pull it from metadata in input0 eventually)</li>
<li>Output our result to a user selectable layer/channelset. If it exists, overwrite it. If not create a new one obviously.</li>
</ul><p>All this should be implemented as an Iop and possibly allow us to sample more pixels (for multi- and super-sampling) in a later version. As a start i will provide a basic implementation (without any real calculations, only doing some debug output). From there i will try to get all the channel handling properly set up and reliable also in bigger and huge production scripts.</p>
