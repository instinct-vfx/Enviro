Towards a reusable NDK channel handling example...

After many fails, times i thought I succeeded and fails again when it comes to
properly implementing channel handling in some of my custom ops I thought I’d
start a public exercise to get a re-usable template for this specific case. I
will make all my findings public as well as share the final result and I am eager
to get any input anyone might have. Be it functional, correcting bugs or tuning
performance/efficiency.
